# My game is "Tic Tac TEO" .
# How to play it ? 
well there's two players competing (player 1 is X , player 2 is O ) and there's also 9 boxes the two players playing one after the other switching turns .
To win , the first one to gather all of thair selections next to each other wins 

# Technologies i used 
HTML , css , JS

# i plan to add 
1-Plyers score
2-The player who wins 5 times first wins the competition
3-The player who wins 3 games in a row wins the competition
4- muliple levels

# some issues 
The function which decide who wins based on the game logic
